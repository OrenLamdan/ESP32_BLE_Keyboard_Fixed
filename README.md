# ESP32_BLE_Keyboard_Fixed

This works with:
ESP board version 2.0.14
It is based on the ESP32_BLE_Keyboard library by T-ck with some changes to the Authentication.
The BLEKeyboardWithButton example: connects to BT and send "hello world" each time the button is pressed. Make sure to connect a button to GPIO4 (other leg to the GND)
